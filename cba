CBA approach:
Take test data from 9/26/13 - 10/2/14
Predict WnvPresent for each entry
Find locations with highest predicted probability
Find dates with highest predicted probability overall
Intersection of these will be the spray plan
Create dataframe with the spray plan (ea spray instance ~$1100)
this is the cost

benefit? how?
Use model to predict updated WnvPresent and find the difference
estimate # of people who catch it? how??
2012 - 174, 5 deaths
2013 - 60, 7 (most spraying occurred in 2013)
multiply by ~14000 (from Sacramento study)
