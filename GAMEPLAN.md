# Game Plan

Let's start out with a timeline.

![alt text](https://github.com/ExSidius/KaggleWestNile/blob/master/imgs/FullSizeRender.jpg "I hope this is legible")

### Data Wrangling

Brice and Ram will have this completed by Thursday.

### EDA

Everybody will work on this until Saturday.

### Model Building

Everyone will work on this until Tuesday.

Some of the different models we will consider are listed below.

Tree-Based Methods - 
1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forests
3. XGBoost

Neural Network - 
* Keras/Lasagne/TensorFlow

We could *potentially* use an ensemble approach by combining different models (e.g. tree based and a neural network, for example)

For each model, we will consider several metrics - 
1. AUC-ROC score
2. Accuracy
3. Confusion Matrix
4. Cost-Benefit Analysis*

*Cost-Benefit Analysis is a metric we will have to determine ourselves. It will also be a primary factor in our presentation.

### Presentation

We'll get to this later on.
